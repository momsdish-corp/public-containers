## Description
A collection of images built for the `linux/arm64` architecture.

## Caution!
Unless otherwise stated, these charts have not been vetted production-ready.

## Disclaimer
The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.

## TODO
Instead of triggering build on each folder change, compare /containers/<container>/<version> to the existing releases.
If there are changes, release a new version, if versions are removed, remove the release, etc...
